# Search Bar Example

This repository contains an example of a search bar layout built using HTML and CSS.

## Features

- **Search Bar**: A text input field with a placeholder for search functionality.
- **Search Icon**: An image (search icon) next to the input field for visual enhancement.
- **Flexbox Layout**: The layout is centered and responsive, ensuring that the search bar looks good on different screen sizes.

## How It Works

1. **HTML Structure**:
   - An `input` element is used to create a text field for users to enter search queries.
   - An `img` element is placed next to the text input to represent the search icon.
   
2. **CSS Styling**:
   - The `input` field is styled with a brown background, and the placeholder text is displayed in beige color.
   - The search icon image is styled with a fixed width and height, and placed next to the input field using flexbox layout.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Markup language for structuring the content.
- **CSS**: Styling for the layout, input field, and image.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>

2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the search bar.

## Usage

## Limitations
- The image source for the search icon (search.png) must be replaced with the actual file path.
- This example does not include any search functionality; it's purely a front-end design.
